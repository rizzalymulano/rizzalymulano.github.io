           <h1>Strenght and Weaknesses in terms of IT Field</h1>
            <p>My strenght is that I have a little background in programming since I took TVL-Programming when I was in Senior High. Also I think that I can include in my strenght that I am willing to learn.</p>
            <p>I honestly think that my greatest weakness in term of IT field is that it is not my first choice and I am not a fast-learner in terms of learning a language.</p>

           <h1>Aspiration</h1>
            <p>I don't usually think what I want in the future because it is easy for me to change my mind. However, I really do aspire to become an Information Technology Lecturer. Not only it is because I want to share my knowledge, I also want to grant my parent's wish. You see my parent's always wanted to have a daughter that have a profession in teaching. Also I have a second aspiration it is to become an Application Programmer. Any of the two will make me happy and I will claim it that I will become either of the  two profession. Goodluck to my future self!</p>
